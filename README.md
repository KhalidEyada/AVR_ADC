# AVR_ADC
ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) Driver for AVR Microcontrollers
ADC

Overview
The ADC Driver for AVR Microcontrollers provides an easy-to-use interface for reading analog signals and converting them into digital values. It simplifies the integration of analog sensors and other analog devices into AVR-based projects, allowing you to perform precise measurements and respond to real-world signals.

Key Features
Configuration: The driver offers functions to set up the ADC clock prescaler, voltage reference, and input channel selection.

Single Conversion: Perform single ADC conversions to read the analog voltage of a specific channel.

Free Running Mode: Enable free-running mode for continuous ADC conversions, ideal for real-time data acquisition.

Interrupt Support: Utilize ADC interrupts to receive notifications when a conversion is complete.

Resolution Options: Configure the ADC for different resolutions (8-bit or 10-bit) based on your application's requirements.

Voltage Reference Options: Support for both internal and external voltage references to suit various sensing scenarios.

Sample Applications: The driver includes well-documented sample applications that demonstrate different ADC usage scenarios.

Installation
To incorporate the ADC Driver into your AVR project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Copy the relevant driver files (adc.c and adc.h) into your project directory.
Include the adc.h header file in your application code.
Usage
Using the ADC Driver involves the following steps:

Initialize the ADC: Call the initialization function to configure the ADC settings, such as voltage reference and clock prescaler.

Configure Input Channels: Select the appropriate input channel(s) from which you want to read analog signals.

Read Analog Data: Use the provided functions to perform single conversions or enable free-running mode to continuously read data.

Optional Interrupt Usage: Configure ADC interrupts to receive notifications when a conversion is complete (optional but beneficial for low-power applications).

// ADC interrupt service routine (ISR) - Optional
ISR(ADC_vect) {
    // ADC conversion complete
    uint16_t adcValue = ADC_get_result();
    // Process the ADC value or perform further actions
}
